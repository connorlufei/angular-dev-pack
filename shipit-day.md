# Angular Dev Extension Pack for VS Code

## Idea Description

Most of our web developers use VS Code for angular development. There are many useful extensions in VS Code market place that greatly speed up our
development and boost our productivity. For example, [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode) is used to statically analyze our code to find out code issues before committing
thus improving our code quality. [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) is used to provide code navigation and auto completion in angular template. With more
developers joining in web development, to install our recommended extensions they have to search them one by one in VS Code market place and
install, which is a rather cumbersome process.

What if we can create an extension group including all the recommended extensions and have developer
install them in one click? VS Code does support that. This is where [VS Code Extension Pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest#extension-packs) comes into play. With extension pack we declare the list of recommended extensions and all of them would get installed automatically if developers install our extension pack.

## What was Shipped

[Angular Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AGFAHealthcareIT.angular-dev-pack), built from [the repo](https://github.com/connorlufei/angular-dev-pack), is now available for installation from VS Code extension market place.
